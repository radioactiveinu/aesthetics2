    Music: Band has been a large portion of my life, but I have only played one instrument: The Saxophone.
    It may look intimidating when you first see it, but believe me,
    it's even worse when you try to play it. I’ve been playing ever since I was in fourth grade,
    so I have been playing for about 7 years now, give or take some breaks in between. My music taste, is another story,
    with me liking many songs of different genres, especially meme songs, like Africa by Toto, or Boom x4 by the Vengaboys,
    but I mostly stick to Rock, Classic Rock, and older songs. I also listen to a sub genre of music called Vaporwave, Dreamwave,
    and Synthwave, and an even more sub genre of music where its played in empty shopping carts and in the room next door. Trust me, it sounds
    dumb in theory but its banging.
